      <h2>Why I'm Beginning this Journey</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on May 19, 2025</em></p>
      <p>I've always been fascinated by the science behind health and wellness, and how to better improve the human condition by providing people an easily accessible way to access this kind of information.</p>
      <p>I'm originally from Raleigh, North Carolina, a smaller scale city in the heart of the state. Raleigh's primary industry is knowledge - with three dynamic universities within close proximity, major tech companies and innovative leaders flock to the region. This, in turn, I think makes Raleigh an exceptional place - where great minds come together to make things happen. I've always trended on the side of being more entrepreneurial, so this is a great way to blend that natural pull and a passion for fitness and bettering peoples lives. 
      <p>This blog will document the process of finding a way to better teach people about fitness and wellness that is holistic in practice, meaning it will focus on three foundational building blocks to wellness: diet, exercise, and mental health.</p>
